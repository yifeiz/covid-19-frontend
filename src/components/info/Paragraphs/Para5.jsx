    Social distancing is used to minimize COVID-19 transmission in the
    community. This means minimizing close contact with others during the peak
    of an outbreak. Where possible, we would encourage you to: avoid public
    transit, stay 6 feet away from others, reduce your exposure in the community
    by avoiding areas such as shopping malls, recreation centers, movie
    theaters, and avoid social gatherings. Overall, try to limit your exposure
    outside the home.
