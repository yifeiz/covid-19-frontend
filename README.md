## Setup / Prereqs

Here are some installation/setup steps for you to run the frontend side of the project.

We highly recommend that you use nvm to make sure that we are all using the same node and npm versions across the field.

Installation link can be found here for

- [Unix/linux](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)
- [Windows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows)

If you'd like to avoid the above package managers, you can install node [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/releases/), and make sure to select node version 10.18.1 (As long as you have node versions above ~8, you should be good)

After making sure you have node and npm on your system, you can run `npm install` and then `npm start` in the root directory to start the project.
